<p>Cricket tops the list when it comes to favourite sports of India. The craze is so much so that some of the Indian cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar and Saurav Ganguly are literally worshipped in our country. A marble statue of Sachin Tendulkar has been set up in a village in Bihar and it is addressed as the God of cricket.</p>
